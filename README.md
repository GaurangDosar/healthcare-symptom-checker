## üéØ Project Summary

A web application that accepts free-text symptom descriptions and optional demographics (age, sex), calls an LLM to generate a ranked list of probable conditions with conservative reasoning and triage advice, stores anonymized query history (with user consent), and displays results with prominent safety disclaimers.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Lovable Cloud (Supabase) with Edge Functions
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **LLM**: OpenAI GPT-5-nano
- **State Management**: TanStack Query
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form + Zod validation

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- OpenAI API key for GPT-5-nano

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Set up environment variables:
The project uses Lovable Cloud, which automatically provisions:
