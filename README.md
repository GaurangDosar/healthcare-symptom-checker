**If you are experiencing severe or life-threatening symptoms (chest pain, severe difficulty breathing, sudden weakness, uncontrolled bleeding), seek emergency medical care immediately.**

## üéØ Project Summary

A web application that accepts free-text symptom descriptions and optional demographics (age, sex), calls an LLM to generate a ranked list of probable conditions with conservative reasoning and triage advice, stores anonymized query history (with user consent), and displays results with prominent safety disclaimers.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components
- **Backend**: Node.js Local Server (with optional Supabase Edge Functions)
